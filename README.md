 Just developed a dynamic Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:

Core Logic Implementation:
Utilized JavaScript ES6 features like arrow functions, const and let for variable declarations to ensure code readability and maintainability.
Implemented the game logic using conditional statements (if...else and switch) to determine the game's outcome.

Event Handling:
Leveraged Event Listeners to capture user input (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and trigger the game round dynamically.
Used DOM Manipulation techniques (e.g., querySelector, textContent, classList) to update the UI based on game results.
Randomization:

Employed Math.random() to generate the computer's choice, ensuring fair play and unpredictability.

Responsive Design:
Styled the game interface with CSS Flexbox to create a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

Interactive User Experience:
Enhanced user interaction with CSS animations and transitions to provide visual feedback on selections and outcomes.
Integrated simple sound effects using the HTML5 <audio> element to enrich the gameplay experience.

Code Modularization:
Structured the codebase with modular JavaScript practices, separating concerns into different functions and modules for better scalability and readability.

Version Control:
Managed project development with Git, ensuring version control and collaborative potential.
